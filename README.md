This project is a web-based cannabis product shop built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its tech stack is:

HTML: Structures the content and layout of the site (index.html, products.html, cart.html).
CSS: Provides styling for a modern, responsive, and visually appealing user interface.
JavaScript: Handles dynamic features such as product filtering, search, cart management, and checkout logic.
How it operates:

Users browse products, filter by category, and search using the UI.
Products can be added to a cart, which is managed in-memory and persisted via sessionStorage.
The cart sidebar allows quantity adjustments and removal of items.
On checkout, users are redirected to cart.html, where they fill out shipping and contact info, select shipping options, and place their order.
All operations are client-side; there is no backend or databaseâ€”data is stored in the browser session.
